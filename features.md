2. **Implement Billing and Subscription (Stripe)** - Critical for revenue and plan enforcement
3. **Develop Contract IDE Navigation** - Add document outline explorer and section folding
4. **Enhance Clause-Aware Editing** - Complete numbering and hierarchical document structure
5. **Complete User Management** - Finish team/workspace UI and permissions
6. **Implement Document Outline View** - Core navigation feature for legal documents
7. **Build Admin Dashboard** - For user and subscription management
8. **Enhance Mobile Experience** - Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

## Conclusion

AccordifyAI has a strong foundation with many core features already implemented. The landing page, AI chat interface, contract summarization, and editor components show significant progress. The immediate focus should be on completing the authentication flow, billing integration, and document structure enhancements to create a fully functional MVP ready for market.
